Many on the Genny is a race I've thought about doing for a few years. This was the third year of the event, and I finally got up the nerve to try it. 40 miles, most of which on Letchworth State Park trails, is very intimidating. Sure, I've run the Battle at Bristol Mountain 50k 3 times, but Many on the Genny is 10 more miles than that. Now that I've done both events I would say they're actually a pretty similar level of difficulty, since Many on the Genny is 10 miles longer but only has about 40% of the elevation change.

My biggest concern going into MotG was my right knee. After running Sehgahunda 72 a month prior my knee had been giving me on-and-off twinges, and I was concerned I would need to drop at some point due to it. My other main concern was being trained enough - my weekly mileage has been hovering around 30 miles per week, which isn't quite where it should be.

After only 4 hours of sleep and an hour drive down to Letchworth State Park, I was at the starting line on the west side of Mount Morris Dam. The race director Eric announced that some portions of the course were underwater, so we would unfortunately be running along the road more than previous years. Since this was my first Many on the Genny, I don't know what I missed out on. Even with slightly less trails on the first half, I knew the 2nd half was 100% trails, following the same trails Sehgahunda runs but in reverse (and no checkpoints!).

At 6am Eric started the race, and we headed north for a quick mile loop before the long journey south. When we passed the start I was tempted to use the bathroom, but decided against it. This was my first mistake of the race, and at mile 8.5 I ended up needing to use the woods. But hey, that's just something you have to deal with as a runner, right?

A couple miles into the race I met up with Joe Ciecierega.
