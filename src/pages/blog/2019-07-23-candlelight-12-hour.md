The [Candlelight 12 Hour Ultra](https://candlelight12hour.org/) 
This was my 3rd ultramarathon in as many fortnights, and I'm definitely starting to feel the fatigue. I've realized that doing so many races so close together is a sacrifice of quality in exchange for quantity. It's fascenating seeing how much (or little) I can get my body to recover in just 2 weeks, but this experience has shown that I shouldn't expect to be fully recovered just 14 days after a race.

In preparation for the sleep deprivation of running from 7pm through 7am, I stayed up until 1am Thursday night and slept until 9am, arriving to work late on Friday. I then stayed up until 3am on Friday, and slept until 11am on Saturday. I think this shift was very helpful, and allowed me to be awake enough to complete the race and safely drive home afterwards.
